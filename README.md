Mad Libs is a game with a basic story template that has blank spaces which need to be filled by the user. 
The fun part is that the user inputs words without knowing the story ahead of time. So the program`
1. Allows the user to pick one of the templates
2. Asks the user to input words. “Type number”, for example
3. Generate a story afterwards and shows it to the user
